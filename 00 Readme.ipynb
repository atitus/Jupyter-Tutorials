    "Jupyter Notebook (formerly called iPython Notebook) is a web application (front-end) to create and share documents that contain live code, visualizations, and marked-up text and equations. Teachers can write tutorials, and students can write professional, interactive reports. Accessible to students and scalable to professionals, Jupyter Notebook is ideal for teaching computational modeling, data visualization, collaborative computing, and reporting.\n",

    "Jupyter allows teachers and students to write **data-driven and code-driven narratives.** The key word in this phrase is \"narratives.\" If you are looking for an IDE, there are many high-quality development environments better than Jupyter. The benefit of Jupyter is integrating data, code, and narrative."
