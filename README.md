# Jupyter-Tutorials
These tutorials began as a presentation to a [conference at MICDS in St. Louis](http://stlinstl.org/). I added additional tutorials based on projects my students have done. They are a work in progress.

Some of the tutorials require you to install the following packages:

- [Jupyter VPython](https://github.com/BruceSherwood/vpython-jupyter) for 3D graphics and vector algebra.
- pyserial for communication with an Arduino.
- [plotly](https://plot.ly/) for interactive graphs and streaming.

These tutorials have been influenced by Ruth Chabay, Bruce Sherwood, Doug Blank, and Steve Spicklemire. Credit is generally given in the tutorial that was influenced by their work.
