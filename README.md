# Jupyter-Tutorials

These tutorials began as a presentation to a [ 2016 conference at MICDS in St. Louis](http://stlinstl.org/) and were improved for a workshopo at the AAPT Meeting in 2017. I added additional tutorials based on projects my students have done. They are a work in progress.

Some of the tutorials require you to install the following packages:

- [VPython](https://github.com/BruceSherwood/vpython-jupyter) for 3D graphics and vector algebra.
- pyserial for communication with an Arduino.
- [plotly](https://plot.ly/) for interactive graphs and streaming.

These tutorials have been influenced by Ruth Chabay, Bruce Sherwood, Doug Blank, and Steve Spicklemire. Credit is generally given in the tutorial that was influenced by their work. In some cases, code snippets were gleaned from Plotly, matplotlib, and other sites.
